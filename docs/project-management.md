# Project Management - MCP-JCR Server MVP

## Overview

This document outlines the project management approach for the MCP-JCR Server MVP Phase 1, emphasizing continuous value delivery and testable increments.

## Core Principles

### 1. Continuous Value Delivery
- Every issue delivers working, demonstrable functionality
- No pure setup/configuration tickets without user value
- Each completion milestone can be shown to stakeholders
- Progress is visible daily, not just at sprint end

### 2. "Make It Work" Philosophy
- Start with minimal viable implementation
- Add sophistication in subsequent iterations
- Focus on end-to-end functionality over perfect architecture
- Optimize after proving the concept works

### 3. Testable Increments
- Each issue includes specific testing instructions
- Manual test commands for immediate validation
- Clear expected outputs and success criteria
- Demo scenarios for stakeholder communication

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Foundation with Immediate Value
**Goal:** Working MCP server with visual proof of progress

1. **Day 1-2**: JCR Repository + Spring Boot Base
   - Docker Compose JCR running with sample content
   - Spring Boot app with health endpoint
   - **Demo:** "Server is running and healthy!"

2. **Day 3**: JCR Connection Service
   - Connect to repository and verify connection
   - Health indicator shows JCR status
   - **Demo:** "Server is connected to JCR and can count nodes!"

3. **Day 4**: First MCP Tool (Query)
   - Complete MCP server configuration
   - Working Query tool accessible via MCP
   - **Demo:** "Claude can now query our JCR repository!"

4. **Day 5**: Basic Web UI
   - Status page showing server and connection info
   - Visual confirmation of progress
   - **Demo:** "Open browser and see real-time status!"

### Week 2: Expand Functionality
**Goal:** Multiple tools with quality assurance

1. **Days 1-2**: Additional Core Tools
   - Fetch tool for node inspection
   - ListChildren for tree exploration
   - **Demo:** "Explore any node and its children!"

2. **Days 3-4**: Quality Infrastructure
   - Code formatting with Ktlint
   - Integration test framework
   - **Demo:** "Automated testing ensures reliability!"

3. **Day 5**: Buffer and Documentation
   - Address any blockers from Week 1-2
   - Update documentation and examples

### Week 3: Complete Feature Set
**Goal:** All read-only tools with enhanced UI

1. **Days 1-3**: Remaining Tools
   - SearchByFullText for content discovery
   - ExportTree for analysis
   - **Demo:** "Complete toolkit for JCR exploration!"

2. **Days 4-5**: Enhanced Web Interface
   - Interactive tool testing forms
   - Query history and results display
   - **Demo:** "Web-based testing without command line!"

### Week 4: Production Ready
**Goal:** Deployable system with distribution

1. **Days 1-2**: Docker Distribution
   - Complete Docker setup
   - Easy deployment instructions
   - **Demo:** "One-command deployment!"

2. **Days 3-5**: Polish and Release
   - Bug fixes and performance optimization
   - Final documentation and examples
   - Release preparation

## Issue Management

### Tracking Issues
For each major phase or milestone, create a META tracking issue that:
- Lists all related implementation issues as GitHub task checkboxes
- Defines the overall goal and success criteria
- Links to relevant documentation
- Provides a single view of progress
- Example: Issue #14 tracks all MVP Phase 1 work

### Issue Structure
Each implementation issue follows this template:
- **Value Delivered**: What working functionality this provides
- **Tasks**: Specific actionable steps
- **Files to Create**: Exact file paths and purposes
- **How to Test**: Command-line validation steps
- **Demo**: Stakeholder-friendly demonstration

### One Issue, One Pull Request
**Goal**: Each issue should be solved by a single cohesive pull request
- **Issue Sizing**: If an issue feels too large for one PR, split it into sub-issues
- **Cohesive Changes**: A PR should contain all code needed to complete the issue's value delivery
- **Atomic Completion**: The PR should make the issue's demo scenario work end-to-end
- **Exceptions**: In practice, some issues may require multiple PRs, but this should be rare
- **Quality Gate**: If you need multiple PRs, consider if the issue should be split instead

### Dependencies
- **Minimize blocking chains**: Most issues depend on 1-2 others max
- **Enable parallel work**: Tools can be developed simultaneously
- **Front-load critical path**: Core infrastructure first

### Acceptance Criteria
Issues are only "Done" when:
- [ ] All tasks completed
- [ ] Manual test commands pass
- [ ] Code builds without warnings
- [ ] Demo scenario works
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **MCP Integration Unknown**: Start with simplest tool (Query) to validate
- **JCR Complexity**: Use Docker setup to isolate repository concerns
- **Spring Boot Learning Curve**: Begin with minimal configuration

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Early Integration Testing**: Test MCP protocol in Week 1
- **Incremental Complexity**: Add features one at a time
- **Fallback Plans**: Each tool independently valuable

### Quality Gates
- **Daily**: Can still demo previous day's work
- **Weekly**: All completed features still work together  
- **End of Phase**: Complete working system ready for next phase

## Communication and Demos

### Daily Progress
- Each issue completion triggers a demo
- Progress visible through GitHub issue status
- Web UI shows real-time system status

### Weekly Reviews
- Demonstrate all completed functionality
- Review upcoming week's priorities
- Adjust timeline based on learnings

### Stakeholder Communication
Use these demo scenarios:
- **Week 1**: "AI can query our content repository"
- **Week 2**: "Multiple exploration tools with automated testing"
- **Week 3**: "Complete web interface for content analysis"
- **Week 4**: "Production-ready deployment"

## Success Metrics

### Velocity Metrics
- Issues completed per week (target: 3-4)
- Blockers resolved within 1 day
- No issue in progress >3 days

### Quality Metrics
- All demo scenarios work
- No regression in previous features
- Code coverage >80% for core components

### Value Metrics
- Stakeholder can use system independently
- Clear value proposition demonstrated
- Ready for Phase 2 expansion

## Tools and Workflow

### GitHub Issues
- All work tracked as issues
- Progress visible through labels and status
- Clear acceptance criteria for each issue

### Development Workflow
1. Move issue to "In Progress"
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement with tests
4. Manual testing per issue instructions
5. Create PR with demo video/screenshots
6. Review and merge
7. Mark issue "Done"

### Project Board Columns
- **Backlog**: Not yet ready to start
- **Ready**: Dependencies met, can start
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked (limit: 2)
- **Review**: PR submitted, awaiting review
- **Done**: Merged and deployed

## Lessons Learned Integration

### From Initial Planning
- Configuration-only tickets provide no stakeholder value
- Large issues create long gaps between demonstrations
- Tool registration should be implicit, not explicit blocker

### Continuous Improvement
- Retrospective after each week
- Adjust issue size based on completion patterns
- Update templates based on what works

## Phase 2 Preparation

### Technical Debt Tracking
- Document shortcuts taken for MVP speed
- Plan architecture improvements for Phase 2
- Identify scalability bottlenecks

### Feature Pipeline
- Collect Phase 2 requirements during MVP development
- Validate Phase 2 assumptions with MVP users
- Prepare seamless transition plan

This project management approach ensures that the MCP-JCR Server MVP delivers continuous value while maintaining quality and setting up for future success.
